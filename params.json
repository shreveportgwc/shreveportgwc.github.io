Our goal is to help girls in our community learn new skills and discover the fun of computer science. We plan to use Github with our higher level students, so they can learn the importance of version control. As our students learn, we will encourage them to join Github and contribute their projects to our organization. \r\n\r\n## For Students\r\n---\r\nThis website is our hub. Here you will find various links to information for you. This includes links to the different websites we will use, instructions for how the curriculum is structured, and other pages that will be updated throughout the year. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
